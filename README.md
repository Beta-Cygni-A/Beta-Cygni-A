### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a console game engine/library (repo name is ConsoleMovementExperiment) + Console Reader
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++ from www.learncpp.com
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on about anything that I can contribute to with C++
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with making programs in C++
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: Here on Github or www.reddit.com/user/Captain_Lesbee_Ziner
- âš¡ Fun fact: I use the following software for programming: Neovim, VSCodium, CodeBlocks, Windows Terminal, Cygwin GDB and g++, Cmake, git, and Godot, plus some new ones since trying out FreeBSD
- Feel free to join me on my current projects, future projects, and contact me about your projects.
